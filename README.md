# Code Challenge - The Key

I decided to solve the problem using a c# web API project in the back end, and a React application in the client side.
To be able to run the application, please follow the following instructions:

1.  Clone the repository in a empty folder
    `git clone https://github.com/eltuna9/TheKey.git`

2.  Open the solution TheKey.sln, and run it from Visual Studio.

3.  From your terminal, open the folder TheKeyAPI/ClientApp and install the npm dependencies
    `npm install`

4.  From the same folder, start the client app.
    `npm start`
